## My favorites

I could simply list the movies I have rated 9/10 or 10/10 throughout my life, but that would be not only underwhelming, it would probably be a bit boring too.
Also, bear in mind that some of my all-time favorites are widely celebrated and universally acknowledged masterpieces.
Naturally, I am talking about the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>The Godfather I & II</em>, <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, and films by legends like Kubrick, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, and so on.

Instead, allow me to share five outstanding films which, while possibly relatively well-known and having garnered a fair amount of attention, I feel not everyone has had the chance to watch or, in some cases, even heard of.
And just to be clear, these five are what came to mind today.
Ask me again next month and I might have a different list.
Let's just say these are the ones that, with a little effort in memory recollection, floated to the surface of my thoughts.

Go watch them!

### 12 Monkeys (1995)

<em>12 Monkeys</em> is directed by Terry Gilliam, best known for his work with Monty Python.
It’s an adaptation of the 1962 French short film La Jetée (directed by Chris Marker), a haunting piece composed entirely of still photographs.

Whenever I'm asked about my favorite time-travel movie, <em>12 Monkeys</em> is always my answer.
Gilliam is a master at making us feel the paranoia that consumes his characters.
His framing and visual style often evoke discomfort and disorientation.
Don't believe me?
Watch Brazil, another one of his sublime works.

What makes <em>12 Monkeys</em> so compelling to me, and why I have watched it countless times, is how it strips time travel of its usual glamor.
Instead, it presents a bleak, chaotic reality where time travel feels more like a punishment: ugly, confusing, and deeply unsettling.
Brad Pitt gets most of the spotlight for his Oscar-nominated performance as a manic lunatic, but it is Bruce Willis who, in my opinion, truly carries the emotional weight.
His portrayal of a man burdened by the impossible task of correcting the past is what sold me on the film's tragic brilliance.

### A Separation (2011)

I remember the first time I watched this film it felt like I was witnessing a documentary unfold.
Nothing about it seems scripted, rehearsed, or even planned, and I mean that in the most positive way.
It plays out as if a hidden camera were quietly capturing the steps, misfortunes, and emotional struggles of an ordinary family in Iran, desperately trying (or not?) to find balance within their household.
Make no mistake: you won't find happiness here.
<em>A Separation</em> is an incredibly sad film, but one that absolutely deserves to be seen.
I believe there is something deeply human to be learned from it...

# IMDb Data Analyzer

There was a time when IMDb provided user statistics within our profiles, but unfortunately, that's no longer the case.

So, I've decided to code a basic (and far from perfect) Python script to bring those statistics back to life, along with some additional ones.

If you have any suggestions for the code or the types of statistics to include, please let me know.

You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/joelreis/imdb-data-analyzer)

To the best of my knowledge, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Jupyter Notebooks do not integrate seamlessly.

To display the notebook shown below, I used the Anaconda Prompt to generate a markdown file by running the following command:

> jupyter nbconvert \-\-to markdown  < file name >.ipynb 

Between this method and converting the notebook to HTML, I prefer the former.
