## My favorites

I could just list the movies I have rated 10/10 over the years, but that would be not only underwhelming, it might also come across as a bit boring and predictable.
Why? Well, because unsurprisingly, many of my all-time favorites are widely celebrated and universally recognized masterpieces.
And really, isn't that the point?

Naturally, I am talking about the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> trilogy, <em>The Matrix</em>, <em>The Godfather I & II</em>, <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em>, <em>The Shawshank Redemption</em>, and films by legends like Kubrick, Kurosawa, Hitchcock, Sergio Leone, and so on.

Instead, allow me to share five outstanding films, plus a few honorable mentions, that, while perhaps relatively well-known and having received a fair amount of attention, I believe not everyone has had the chance to watch or, in some cases, even hear of.
Just to be clear, these suggestions reflect what came to mind on the particular day I wrote this.
On another day, I might have come up with a completely different list.
Let's just say these are the ones that, with a bit of effort in digging through my memory, happened to rise to the surface.

Go watch them!

### 12 Monkeys (1995)

<em>12 Monkeys</em> is directed by Terry Gilliam, best known for his work with Monty Python.
It's an adaptation of the 1962 French short film La Jetée (directed by Chris Marker), a haunting piece composed entirely of still photographs (check it on YouTube).

Whenever I'm asked about my favorite time-travel movie, <em>12 Monkeys</em> is always my answer.
Gilliam is a master at making us feel the paranoia that consumes his characters.
His framing and visual style often evoke discomfort and disorientation.
Don't believe me?
Also watch <em>Brazil</em>, another one of his sublime works.

What makes <em>12 Monkeys</em> so compelling to me, and why I have watched it countless times, is how it strips time-travel of its usual glamor and hopefulness.
Instead, it presents a bleak, chaotic reality where time travel feels more like a punishment: ugly, confusing, and deeply unsettling.
Brad Pitt gets most of the spotlight for his Oscar-nominated performance as a manic lunatic, but it is Bruce Willis who, in my opinion, truly carries the emotional weight.
His portrayal of a man burdened by the impossible task of correcting the past is what sold me on the film's tragic brilliance.

Honorable mentions in time-travel cinema: <em>Primer</em> (2004), <em>Timecrimes</em> (2007), <em>Triangle</em> (2009).

### A Separation (2011)

I remember the first time I watched this film it felt like I was witnessing a documentary unfold.
Nothing about it seems scripted, rehearsed, or even planned, and I mean that in the most positive way.
It plays out as if a hidden camera were quietly capturing the steps, misfortunes, and emotional struggles of an ordinary family in Iran, desperately trying (or not?) to find balance within their household.
The opening scene alone is enough to draw us in, highlighting the complexity and moral ambiguity behind the difficult choices people often face.
Make no mistake: you won't find happiness here.
<em>A Separation</em> is an incredibly heartbreaking film, but one that absolutely deserves to be seen, rich in dialogue and emotional depth.
I believe there is something profoundly human to be learned from it...

Honorable mentions in family drama: <em>La graine et le mulet</em> (2007), <em>Kramer vs. Kramer</em> (1979), <em>Le Passé</em> (2013), <em>The Squid and the Whale (2005).

### The Secret in Their Eyes (2009)

This Argentine-Spanish production won the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, so it’s hardly an obscure title that flew under the radar.
Still, I believe it deserves a place on this list.

Technically impressive at times, its emotional impact lingers long after the credits roll.
As I tried to process the implications of the choices made by certain characters, I found myself in one of those quiet, reflective moments, wondering: what would I have done?

Honorable mentions in films that might stir existential dread: <em>Oldboy</em> (2003), <em>Contratiempo</em> (2016), <em>The Game</em> (1997), <em>Memento</em> (2000), <em>Ad Astra</em> (2019).

# IMDb Data Analyzer

There was a time when IMDb provided user statistics within our profiles, but unfortunately, that's no longer the case.

So, I've decided to code a basic (and far from perfect) Python script to bring those statistics back to life, along with some additional ones.

If you have any suggestions for the code or the types of statistics to include, please let me know.

You can check out the code [here](https://github.com/joelreis/imdb-data-analyzer)

To the best of my knowledge, GitHub Pages, Jekyll, and Jupyter Notebooks do not integrate seamlessly.

To display the notebook shown below, I used the Anaconda Prompt to generate a markdown file by running the following command:

> jupyter nbconvert \-\-to markdown  < file name >.ipynb 

Between this method and converting the notebook to HTML, I prefer the former.
