<br>

Here I disclose (some of) the programs/applications that I use frequently in my research activities.

Naturally, it's all a matter of personal preference. 

I use mostly macOS and Windows operative systems when preparing my documents and presentations. 

I use Linux for more applied stuff related to the programming of autonomous vehicles.

I am always open to try new software.

Document Writing/Preparation
======

TexStudio
------

*TeXstudio is an integrated writing environment for creating LaTeX documents.
Our goal is to make writing LaTeX as easy and comfortable as possible.
Therefore TeXstudio has numerous features like syntax-highlighting, integrated viewer, reference checking, and various assistants.*

**Note:** If you have never used LaTeX, I recommend you start with an online editor like, for instance, Overleaf, where dozens of templates and a spectacular knowledge base are available: Overleaf LaTeX knowledge base.


JabRef
------

*JabRef is an open-sourced, cross-platform citation and reference management software. It uses BibTeX and BibLaTeX as its native formats and is therefore typically used for LaTeX.*


LaTeXiT
------

*LaTeXiT is a small utility that allows you to quickly typeset LaTeX equations, without bothering with file creation, preambles, and so on. The PDF image obtained can then be exported by drag'n drop to any application supporting it.*

**Note:** Only available for macOS.

Programming
======

MATLAB
------

*MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.*

Robot Operating System
------

*The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source.*

Miscellaneous
======

GitHub Desktop
------

<img src="/images/github.png" style="float:left; margin:0px 15px 15px 0px; cursor:pointer; cursor:hand; border:0" width="100" height="100"/>

*With GitHub Desktop, you can interact with GitHub using a GUI instead of the command line or a web browser. You can use GitHub Desktop to complete most Git commands from your desktop, such as pushing to, pulling from, and cloning remote repositories, attributing commits, and creating pull requests, with visual confirmation of changes.*


Cyberduck

*Zotero is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, annotate, cite, and share research. Zotero helps you organize your research any way you want. You can sort items into collections and tag them with keywords. Or create saved searches that automatically fill with relevant materials as you work.*
