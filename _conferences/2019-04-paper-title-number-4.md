This article describes an offline calibration methodology, resorting to a three-axis rate and positioning table, for high-grade inertial measurement units that encompass three sets of triaxial sensors: advanced fiber optic gyroscopes sensitive to the Earth's rotational velocity; low-noise accelerometers; and integrated magnetometers.
