**Abstract**
---
In this paper, we propose a novel event-triggered prescribed-time tracking (PTT) control method for an underactuated unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
Unlike existing PTT control methods, where the transient behavior of the system depends solely on the controller gains, we design a novel reference error trajectory (RET) using a polynomial to guide the convergence of the tracking error, particularly during the transient phase.
Based on this RET and within the backstepping framework, we design a thrust reference.
Additionally, we introduce a novel event-triggered mechanism based on the tracking error to update the torque applied to the UAV.
To streamline intricate mathematical expressions and improve robustness to external disturbances, a second-order linear system is used as a low-pass filter within the backstepping design.
Finally, simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and validate the accuracy of the theoretical predictions.
