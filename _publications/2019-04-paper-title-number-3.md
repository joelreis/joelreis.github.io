excerpt: 'This letter presents a novel attitude estimation solution, built on SO(3) , that resorts to single measurements of a constant inertial vector, in addition to angular velocity readings provided by a set of three high-grade fiber optic rate gyros, which are assumed to be sensitive to the angular motion of the Earth.'

This letter presents a novel attitude estimation solution, built on SO(3) , that resorts to single measurements of a constant inertial vector, in addition to angular velocity readings provided by a set of three high-grade fiber optic rate gyros, which are assumed to be sensitive to the angular motion of the Earth.
