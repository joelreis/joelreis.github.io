**Abstract**
---
This paper presents trajectory generation and output-feedback control strategies for an underactuated Flying Inverted Pendulum (FIP) system operating under unknown time-varying disturbances.
The proposed approach introduces a novel scheme that employs two Extended High Gain Observers (EHGOs) to efficiently estimate the inverted pendulum’s linear and angular velocities, as well as the unknown disturbances, independently.
The control strategy integrates a nonlinear hierarchical Lyapunov-based framework with EHGOs to tackle complex trajectory-tracking missions. Leveraging the differential flatness property of the FIP system, a versatile trajectory generation method is developed for window-crossing maneuvers. 
This work marks a step toward achieving closed-loop integration of trajectory generation and nonlinear control for the aggressive maneuvering of an underactuated FIP.
The robustness and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms are validated through numerical simulations and experimental tests, using an underactuated aerial vehicle as a benchmark.
