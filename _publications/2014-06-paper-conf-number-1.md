**Abstract**
---
This paper presents a localization solution for the study of tagged marine animals (sources) based on direction and Doppler measurements.
The source localization, in 3-D, is supported by a Portable Underwater Robotic Tool (PURT), comprising a Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) aided INS navigation system, carried by a diver (agent).
Furthermore, a Surface Robotic Tool (SRT) provides the agent with its absolute position expressed in inertial coordinates.
The observability of the system is studied and realistic simulation results are presented, in the presence of measurement noise.
